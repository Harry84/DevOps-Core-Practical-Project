# Pilots and Tier Random Assignment

# Assignment

To create an app comprising of four services.  Service 1 acts as a Front End for Service 2 and 3.  Service 2 and 3 relate to the Pilot and Tier assignment categories.  Essentially each application assigns a random choice from a list of possible choices for each category and then provides this to the Front End.  The Front End in turn then provides Service 4 with a combination of the strings generated by Services 2 and 3 in the form of a JSON.  Some conditional logic is applied - if a pilot has a certain name then he/she is automatically assigned a pre-determined tier which overwrites the randomly assigned one.  An addional message is also supplied depending on the tier rating.  All this is then relayed back to the front end and displayed seperately.
