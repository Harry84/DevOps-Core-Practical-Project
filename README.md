# Pilots and Tier Random Assignment

# Task

To create an app comprising of four services.  Service 1 acts as a Front End for Service 2 and 3.  Service 2 and 3 relate to the Pilot and Tier assignment categories.  Essentially each application assigns a random choice from a list of possible choices (in string format) for both the "Pilot" and "Tier" categories and then provides these to the Front End.  The Front End in turn then provides Service 4 with a combination of the strings generated by Services 2 and 3 in the form of a JSON.  Some conditional logic is applied - if a pilot has a certain name then he/she is automatically assigned a pre-determined tier which overwrites the randomly assigned one.  An addional message is also supplied depending on the tier rating.  All this is then relayed back to the front end and displayed seperately.

# Project specs

1. Trello Board or equivalent
2. Application with a feature-branch model VCS
3. Application built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine. 
4. Webhooks such that Jenkins rebuilds and redeploys the newest version of the application whenever the main branch is updated (i.e. a change to the codebase)
5. Porject uses Service-Oriented architecture: both containerisation and an orchestration tool.
6. An Ansible Playbook that provisions the environment needed for the application run.
7. A reverse proxy to make the application accessible to the user.
